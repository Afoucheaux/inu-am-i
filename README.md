## About The Project
  * Work on this project has stopped as of Apr 26 2021.

This project is a solo project that utilizes Create React App, to build an application. The Application allows users to match Shiba Inu's images from a mix of dogs and cats. A user page and functionality to view past rounds. Throughout the project the goal was to demonstrate competency in the following technologies:

- Architect an application structure using functional components and hooks.
- Show competency with React fundamentals
- Continue working with React components & asynchronous JS using Cypress testing
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

- [Project Brief and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html)
- visit deployed site [here](https://inu-am-i.herokuapp.com/)
#### Built With:

- React
- React Router
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS
- Cypress

## Set-up Instructions

visit deployed site [here](https://inu-am-i.herokuapp.com/)

1. Additionally you can clone down the repo [here](https://github.com/Afoucheaux/inu-am-i)
2. Move into the inu-am-i directory in your terminal.
3. To see the code itself locally, run `<name of text editor> .`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- visit http://localhost:3000/

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrates competence in the following technologies.
- React fundamentals including components, props, state, JSX, hooks.
- E2E (end to end) testing using Cypress.
- Utilize React Router
- Asynchronous JavaScript

## Challenges

1. Planning: intentionally planning an overall strategy before writing code. This included component structures and state if applicable
2. Using Cypress testing, to implement E2E testing and throughly test all user flows including stubbing api calls.
3. 6 day time frame.
4. Maintaining multiple rounds in the player view.

## Wins

1. Complete MVP user flows.
2. Gained more insight into React Router and state.

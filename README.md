## About The Project

This project utilizes Create React App to build an application which allows users to play a game that matches shiba inu's images from a mix of dogs and cats. Throughout the project,  goals was to demonstrate competency in the following technologies:

- Architect an application structure using functional components and hooks.
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Continue working with React components & asynchronous JS using Cypress testing
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

- [Project Brief and Rubric](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/niche-audience.html)

#### Built With:

- React
- React Router
- Javascript
- HTML5
- CSS
- Cypress

## Set-up Instructions

visit deployed site [here]()

1. Additionally you can clone down the repo [here](https://github.com/Afoucheaux/inu-am-i)
2. Move into the inu-am-i directory in your terminal.
3. To see the code itself locally, run `<name of text editor> .`
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm start`
- visit http://localhost:3000/

## Learning Goals

- Demonstrates competence in the following technologies.
- React fundamentals including components, props, state, JSX, hooks.
- E2E (end to end) testing using Cypress.
- Utilize React Router.
- Asynchronous JavaScript (api calls)

## Challenges

1. Planning: intentionally planning an overall strategy before writing code. This included component structures and state if applicable
2. Using Cypress testing, to implement E2E testing and throughly test all user flows including stubbing api calls.

## Wins

1. Complete MVP user flows.
2. Learned more about React Router and state.
